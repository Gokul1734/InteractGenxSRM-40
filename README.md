## Browser Extension Integration

This UI is designed to integrate with a browser extension backend. The current implementation uses:

- Placeholder event handlers
- Simulated real-time updates

To integrate with actual browser extension APIs, replace the mock data and handlers with Chrome Extension API calls.

## Styling

- Clean card-based layout
- Full-width single-column design
- Gradient backgrounds
- Rounded corners and shadows
- Responsive design
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Color-coded status indicators
- User lists in sessions showing roles (host/viewer)
